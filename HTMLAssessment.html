        "<strong>Whatever</strong> your gravity is when you get to the door, remember -- the enemy's gate is down. If you step through your own door like you're out for a stroll, you're a big target and you deserve to get hit. With more than a flasher."
        Ender Wiggins paused and looked over the group. Most were just watching him nervously. A few understanding. A few sullen and resisting.

        <blockquote>
            <em><strong>First</strong> day with this army, all fresh from the teacher squads, and Ender had forgotten how young new kids could be. He'd been in it for three years, they'd had six months -- nobody over nine years old in the whole bunch. But they were his. At eleven, he
    was half a year early to be a commander. He'd had a toon of his own and knew a few tricks, but there were forty in his new army. Green.</em>

            <strong>All</strong> marksmen with a flasher, all in top shape, or they wouldn't be here -- but they were all just as likely as not to get wiped out first time into battle. "Remember," he went on, "they can't see you till you get through that
            door. But the second you're out, they'll be on you. So hit that door the way you want to be when they shoot at you. Legs up under you, going straight down." He pointed at a sullen kid who looked like he was only seven, the smallest of them
            all. "Which way is down, greenoh!"
